# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this LilyPad USB Plus
wearables/drone demo repo!

## Ways to contribute

- Improve or extend the existing sketches (new patterns, modes, or
  sensors).
- Add new examples using the LilyPad USB Plus for other wearables or
  interactive art projects.
- Fix bugs or clarify documentation in the READMEs.

## Getting started

1. **Fork** this repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a branch** for your change:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-idea
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Keep code readable and well-commented.
   - Update or add a README section if behavior changes.

4. **Test on hardware**
   - Whenever possible, verify sketches on a real LilyPad USB Plus.

5. **Commit with a clear message**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe your change here"
   ```

6. **Open a pull request**
   - Describe what you changed and how to test it.
   - Include any notes about hardware setup (buttons, sensors, drones,
     etc.).

## Code style

- Use clear, descriptive names for pins and modes.
- Keep sketches small and focused; prefer additional examples over
  one huge file with many unrelated features.
- Add short header comments to new `.ino` files describing purpose,
  author, board, and behavior.
